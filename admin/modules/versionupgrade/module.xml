	</changelog>
	<description>
		Fully automates and upgrades the PBX to the next major release for free.
	</description>
	<attention>
		You will be updated to the next version. You should make sure you have a full backup of your current system. Version 14+ requires Asterisk 11 or later. Once you upgrade, you can not downgrade. It may be possible to restore a backup though restoring a system that has been upgraded can run into some anomalies later on though will usually get you back to where you were.
