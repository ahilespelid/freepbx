# astman-nodejs changelog

## vNEXT (2019-??-??)

 * Forked from https://github.com/pipobscure/NodeJS-AsteriskManager
 * Constrain backoff algorithm. The old algorithm was a factorial backoff
   instead of exponential, so it grew *way* too fast. It also had no maximum,
   which aggravated the issue. The new algorithm is merely exponential, and
   maxes out a 60 seconds.
 * Add .gitignore
 * Correct reconnect parameters. Turns out reconnect never worked.
